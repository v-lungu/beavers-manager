# Welcome to Beaver Scout Management Program (**BSMP**)!

This application stores information on Beaver Scouts, a co-ed youth organization that offers children indoor programming and outdoor adventures to prepare them for success in the world.

BSMP can be used by scout leaders to:
- track beaver, guardian, and club leader personal information
- track leader training, roles, and privileges within the colony
- add and remove badges, activities, and meetings
- monitor past activities and meetings and who was leading and in attendance
- maintain information on skits, songs, crafts, and meeting locations
- filter through and select events to easily retrieve information related to the event
